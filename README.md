Simple Number Guessing Game

This Python project implements a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a predefined number. The user is prompted to enter their guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. Once the user correctly guesses the number, the program congratulates them and displays the number of guesses it took. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to basic input/output operations and loop structures in Python. It's a fun way to practice programming logic and improve problem-solving skills. Let's play and see how quickly you can guess the number! ðŸŽ® #Python #GuessingGame #BeginnerFriendly
